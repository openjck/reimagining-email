I dedicate 30 minutes every morning to cleaning up my inbox. I know people who 
have thousands of unread messages. There's a one-hour presentation and a 
240-page book on keeping it all organized. It doesn't have to be this hard.

Here, I share mockup proposals for improving email. Each directory represents 
one set of mockups and  provides a file named "mockups.pdf" outlining these
mockups.
